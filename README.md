## Projects

All projects are just suggestions that we already have the equipment for - if you have your own ideas, all the better ðŸ’¡

### Introduction to Sensing: quickstart project on Arduino and sensors. distance, motion and gyroscope. Check the YouTube video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9UCSynDEw8

### Hack the Duck: take one of our duck-parts kits and add light/sound/motion/whatever you can imagine. Go from hackathon to quackathon in 48 hours :)

### Plant Watering: Help save the FabLab plants from our human incompetence! Build a gravity-based system and soil moisture sensors to automatically water a plant when it needs it most. Extend the project with a web-server to monitor watering stats remotely.

### 8-bit Drum Machine: how to - using buttons, sensors or any way you can imagine. Swap out the sounds for your own set and find a completely new use (inside a duck?)

### Motors and Platforms: build a joystick-controlled 3D maze, then adapt the concept to make a self-levelling platform, the fundamental starting point for a drone.
