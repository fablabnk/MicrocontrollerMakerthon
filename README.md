	- Introduction round: getting to know each other & the support team
	- Starter project: introduction to sensing
	- Brainstorming and idea generation
- 20:30 Donuts and decisions: project choices, naming of teams
- 21:00 Planning and making!

### Sat 10-22

- 14:00 Get-together 1: coffee + discuss project progress
- 20:30 Get-together 2: foodshared late dinner + discuss project progress
- 22:00 Official close (or make into the night!)

### Sun 10-14
- 10:00 Lab opens: finalising of projects
- 13:30 Pitches and prizes deadline
- 14:00 Buffet lunch, official event close
- 15:00 48NK walking tour (optional)

## Key things
- aim is proof of concept prototypes: not finished products
- use a hub: don't burn our lab PC USB ports :)
- bring extra equipment - we don't have everything!
	- USB cables (micro, C, mini), breadboards, etc (label your stuff)
- share your code by making a pull request to this repo in a folder with your team name i.e `team_superamazing`
- share knowledge/inspiration in the #makerthon Slack channel
- if you're not a 42 student use bathrooms @ workish

## Suggested Projects

All projects are just jumping-off points that we already have some equipment for - if you have your own ideas, all the better ðŸ’¡

### 1: Introduction to Arduino and Sensors

- We will kick-off the makerthon with (this project)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9UCSynDEw8] to learn and refresh some basics
- Sensors are the core of most microcontroller projects
	- practice with four of them to measure temperature, humidity, distance, motion and orientation
- Use what you learn as the basis for your Makerthon project

### 2: Hack the Duck

- We have created 3D-printed hollowed out duck-parts kits for you to experiment with :)
- Take a kit and add light, sound, motion or whatever you can imagine
- Go from hackathon to quackathon in 48 hours

### 3: Automatic Plant Watering

- Help save the FabLab plants from our human incompetence by using soil moisture sensors to water a plant when it needs it most
- Build your own no-pump water dispensing system. Starting point [here](https://www.instructables.com/No-Pump-Automatic-Watering/)
- Extend the project with a web-server to monitor watering stats remotely

### 4: Motors and Platforms

- Assemble a [joystick-controlled maze](https://www.tinkercad.com/projects/Simple-Arduino-Maze-Robot-for-Project-Based-Learni]) using 3D printed parts and two servo motors
- Adapt the project with a gyroscope sensor to make a self-levelling platform
- Find your own use-case: self-levelling platform technology is used in camera stabilisation, hoverboards, drones and earthquake-proof buildings
- See [example code from Hannes]([./4_Motors_and_Platforms/hannes_self_levelling_platform.ino]), who built such a platform with lego last year

### 8-Bit Music Machines

- Hack and modify one of our Arduino-based projects from SynthLab: a [drum player](https://github.com/wgd-modular/utf-8-samplified), [dual oscillator](https://github.com/Blinken-Lights/ASCII/tree/main/8%20Bit%20Waves) or [clock sequencer](https://github.com/fablabnk/HagiwoClockMultiDivide)
- Modify our [jumping off point](https://github.com/fablabnk/ArduinoDrumMachine) and find your own sound
- Find a new way to control it. Use sensors? Fabricate a case? Place it inside a duck?

## Support Team : Who's Around When?

- FabLab managers Graham or Zandra will be around during opening hours
- The full team is: Graham, Zandra, Jack, Laurent, Pavlos and Olimpiya
- The person(s) in charge will be wearing the FabLab admin badge

### Shift Schedule
